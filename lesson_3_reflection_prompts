Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Obviously i want the changes in gitHub to be pulled directly to my working repository but not my changes to be pushed to the gitGub.
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
the clone works btw the repository on local and github repository, fork on the github repositories and the branch only on one localk
